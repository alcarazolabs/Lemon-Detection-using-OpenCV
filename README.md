# Lemon-Detection-using-OpenCV

To count the no of Lemons displayed in the image using Hough Circles.

The circle Hough Transform (CHT) is a basic technique used in Digital Image Processing, for detecting circular objects in a digital image.

The circle Hough Transform (CHT) is a feature extraction technique for detecting circles. 
It is a specialization of Hough Transform. The purpose of the technique is to find circles in imperfect image inputs. 
The circle candidates are produced by “voting” in the Hough parameter space and then select the local maxima in a 
so-called accumulator matrix.
